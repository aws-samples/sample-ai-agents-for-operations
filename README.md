# Sample AI Agents for Operations

A collection of sample AI agents that demonstrate how to automate IT operations tasks using AWS services. These agents help operations teams reduce manual toil, accelerate incident response, and enforce best practices through intelligent automation.

Each agent is a self-contained, deployable solution that follows a common pattern:
- **Receive** operational signals (health events, monitoring gaps, quota pressure, cost anomalies, security findings)
- **Reason** about the signal using LLMs (Amazon Bedrock)
- **Act** with appropriate guardrails (human-in-the-loop for high-risk actions)

## Agents by Domain

| Domain | Agent | Description | Status |
|---|---|---|---|
| **Health** | [AWS Health Notification Agent](health/aws-health-notification-agent/) | Classifies AWS Health Dashboard notifications, performs cross-account impact analysis, creates Jira tickets, and optionally executes approved remediation | Available |
| **Observability** | [MIO Agent](observability/mio-agent/) | Continuously assesses monitoring and observability posture, scores maturity across 5 dimensions, and generates prioritized gap reports with implementation-ready fixes | Available |
| **Cloud Governance** | [Bedrock Quota Assistant](governance/bedrock-quota-assistant/) | Explains Amazon Bedrock usage, compares utilization against TPM/RPM quotas, and drafts or submits quota increase requests — via CLI or Slack | Available |
| **Cost Optimization** | _Coming soon_ | Identifies misconfigured architectures and underutilized resources, suggests optimization plans | Planned |
| **Resiliency** | _Coming soon_ | Monitors resilience posture, recommends failover actions, validates recovery procedures | Planned |
| **Security** | _Coming soon_ | Automated security posture assessment, compliance drift detection, remediation guidance | Planned |

## Design Principles

These agents are built around a shared set of principles:

1. **Trust Through Incremental Validation** — Agents begin in observe-and-report mode. Autonomous actions are earned through demonstrated reliability, not granted by default.

2. **Human-in-the-Loop for Mutations** — Any action that modifies infrastructure requires explicit human approval via cryptographic tokens, two-step confirmation, or identity-aware authorization. Read-only operations are autonomous.

3. **Least-Privilege by Default** — IAM roles grant only read permissions out of the box. You must explicitly opt in to enable mutating capabilities after reviewing documented risks.

4. **Solve Real Problems** — Each agent addresses a specific operational challenge encountered in real-world environments, not hypothetical scenarios.

5. **Build for Self-Sufficiency** — Agents are fully deployable with a single command. You own and evolve your solution without dependency on external teams.

## Agent Autonomy Levels

Each agent documents its autonomy level and the conditions for progression:

| Level | Description | Example |
|---|---|---|
| **L0 — Observe** | Report findings only, no actions | Classify health events → publish to SNS |
| **L1 — Recommend** | Suggest actions, human decides | "Cluster X needs upgrade by July 23" → Jira ticket |
| **L2 — Confirm** | Propose action, human approves | "Upgrade cluster X?" → approval email → execute |
| **L3 — Autonomous** | Act within boundaries, report after | Auto-tag untagged resources (low-risk, reversible) |

Progression from L0 → L3 requires validated trust metrics: action success rate, false-positive rate, and blast radius assessment.

Where today's agents sit:

- **MIO Agent** — L0–L1. Read-only by design; it reports findings and recommends fixes but holds no write permissions in your account.
- **Bedrock Quota Assistant** — L1–L2. Analysis and drafting are autonomous; submitting a quota increase support case (its only mutating action) requires explicit user confirmation.
- **AWS Health Notification Agent** — L1–L2. Classification and ticket creation are autonomous; remediation runs only after human approval.

## Technology Stack

Every agent is written in Python 3.12+, reasons with Amazon Bedrock (Claude Sonnet by default, configurable), defines its infrastructure as code, and deploys with a single command. The framework, runtime, and IaC tool vary by agent:

| Agent | Agent Framework | Runtime | Infrastructure | Deploy |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| [AWS Health Notification Agent](health/aws-health-notification-agent/) | [Strands Agents](https://github.com/strands-agents/sdk-python) | Bedrock AgentCore Runtime + Lambda | CloudFormation (SAM transform) | `./deploy.sh` |
| [MIO Agent](observability/mio-agent/) | Multi-agent coordinator on the Bedrock Converse API (boto3) | AWS Lambda + API Gateway | AWS CDK v2 (Python) | `cdk deploy` |
| [Bedrock Quota Assistant](governance/bedrock-quota-assistant/) | [Strands Agents](https://github.com/strands-agents/sdk-python) | Bedrock AgentCore Runtime (container) | AWS CDK v2 (Python) | `make deploy` |

Individual agents may add domain-specific integrations (Jira, Slack, AgentCore Memory, MCP servers, etc.) documented in their own README.

## Getting Started

Each agent has its own README with prerequisites and deployment instructions. Clone the repository, change into the agent folder, and run its one-command deploy:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/aws-samples/sample-ai-agents-for-operations.git
cd sample-ai-agents-for-operations
```

Then pick one agent (all paths are relative to the repository root):

```bash
# Health — AWS Health Notification Agent
(cd health/aws-health-notification-agent && ./deploy.sh)

# Observability — MIO Agent
(cd observability/mio-agent/infrastructure && cdk deploy)

# Cloud Governance — Bedrock Quota Assistant
(cd governance/bedrock-quota-assistant && make deploy)
```

Start with the [AWS Health Notification Agent](health/aws-health-notification-agent/) — it demonstrates the full pattern including classification, impact analysis, multi-channel notifications, and human-approved remediation. If you want a read-only agent to evaluate first, the [MIO Agent](observability/mio-agent/) never requests write permissions.

## Customise with Kiro IDE

These sample agents are designed to be customised using [Kiro IDE](https://kiro.dev)'s **spec-driven development** workflow. The [AWS Health Notification Agent](health/aws-health-notification-agent/) and [Bedrock Quota Assistant](governance/bedrock-quota-assistant/) ship with a `.kiro/specs/` folder containing structured specification files that Kiro uses to understand the agent's architecture and guide your modifications. Agents without specs can still be customised — Kiro will generate specs from the existing code.

```
<agent>/.kiro/specs/
├── <feature-1>/
│   ├── requirements.md    # What the feature does and acceptance criteria
│   ├── design.md          # How it's implemented (architecture, data flow, APIs)
│   └── tasks.md           # Implementation tasks with completion status
├── <feature-2>/
│   ├── requirements.md
│   ├── design.md
│   └── tasks.md
└── ...
```

### How to customise an agent

1. **Open the agent folder in Kiro IDE** — Kiro automatically discovers the `.kiro/specs/` folder and understands the agent's architecture
2. **Tell Kiro what you want in natural language** — e.g., "I want to send notifications to PagerDuty instead of Slack" or "Add a new classification category for compliance events"
3. **Kiro generates the spec for you** — it creates the requirements, design, and task breakdown automatically, following the patterns established by existing specs
4. **Review and refine** — adjust the generated spec if needed, then let Kiro implement the code changes guided by the spec

You don't need to write specs manually — Kiro builds them from your natural language description using the existing specs as architectural context.

### Example customisations

| What you want to do | Tell Kiro |
|---|---|
| Add a new notification channel | "Send notifications to PagerDuty instead of Slack" |
| Change classification rules | "Add a COMPLIANCE category for regulatory events" |
| Add a new remediation action | "Support RDS engine upgrades with the same approval flow as EKS" |
| Integrate with a different ticketing system | "Replace Jira with ServiceNow for ticket creation" |
| Add team routing by new criteria | "Route tickets by AWS resource tag 'Team' in addition to OU" |
| Reweight an assessment score | "Weight distributed tracing at 30% in the Observability Maturity Score" |
| Extend quota coverage to another service | "Check SageMaker endpoint quotas alongside Bedrock quotas" |

Kiro uses the existing specs as architectural context — it understands how the current integrations work and generates changes that fit the established patterns.

## Contributing

We welcome contributions — bug fixes, documentation improvements, and new agents. See [CONTRIBUTING.md](CONTRIBUTING.md) for guidelines.

If you build an agent that solves an operational challenge and want to share it, open a pull request with:

1. The agent in the appropriate domain folder
2. A README with deployment instructions
3. A threat model for any infrastructure-modifying actions
4. Unit tests runnable without AWS credentials

### Agent Design Standards

Every agent in this repository follows these standards:

- Deploy with a single command (`deploy.sh`)
- Work in the deployer's own AWS account (no cross-account assumptions)
- Default to read-only IAM permissions (mutations require explicit opt-in)
- Include human-in-the-loop for any infrastructure-modifying actions
- Document failure modes and blast radius for mutating actions
- Follow the [AWS Shared Responsibility Model](https://aws.amazon.com/compliance/shared-responsibility-model/)

## Security

All agents follow a defense-in-depth security model:

- **IAM least-privilege** — Scoped to specific resource ARNs, read-only by default
- **Encryption** — Data at rest (KMS) and in transit (TLS 1.2+)
- **Human approval gates** — Cryptographic tokens for mutating actions
- **Audit trails** — CloudTrail + CloudWatch for all API calls
- **Prompt injection defense** — Structured system prompts with input/instruction separation

For security concerns, see [CONTRIBUTING.md](CONTRIBUTING.md#security-issue-notifications).

## Important Notes

- **This is sample code, not a production service.** These agents demonstrate how to use AWS services for operational automation. They are provided as starting points for your own implementations, not as maintained software products.
- **No warranty.** This code is provided as-is. Review, test, and adapt it for your environment before production use.
- **Your responsibility.** Once deployed in your account, you are responsible for the security, cost, and operational management of these resources per the [AWS Shared Responsibility Model](https://aws.amazon.com/compliance/shared-responsibility-model/).
- **Not published to package indexes.** These samples are not available via pip, npm, or Maven. Clone this repository to use them.
- **Feedback welcome.** File issues or pull requests on GitHub. We review contributions but cannot guarantee response times.
